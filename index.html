    <div>symptoms, etiology, pathology and prognosis. This system was developed during the<br>
early 1990s by Massachusetts General Hospital and has been used by thousands of<br>
physicians and medical students</div><br>
    <div>
    DXplain uses a set of signs, symptoms, and laboratory results to produce a ranked list<br>
of diagnoses which might explain the clinical manifestations. DXplain uses Bayesian<br>
logic to derive the clinical diagnosis interpretation (MedExpert-DxPlain, 2004). It is<br>
important to note that the system only provides suggestion and not definitive conclu-<br>sions. Since this system is in production and licensed as a product, the knowledge base<br>
should be continually updated.
    </div><br>
    <div>DXplain is routinely used at medical schools for clinical education. DXplain diagnosis<br>
decision system has characteristics of an electronic medical textbook and a reference<br>
system. After receiving the inputs, the system develops a list of ranked diagnosis based<br>
on the input and provides the justification. This is one of the main reasons why this<br>
system is used widely for education purposes.</div><br>
    <div>DXplain system provides about 10 appropriate references for each suggested diagnosis.<br>
The user interface for the DXplain system is very intuitive with graphical user interface<br>
requiring only clicks from the lists to drill down to the recommendations. This is one of<br>
the main reasons suggested for the success of this product.</div><br>
    
    <h3>RMRS</h3>
    <hr><br>
    <div>Regenstrief Medical Records System (RMRS) is one of the oldest, popular, and com-<br>monly cited decision support system in the United States. RMRS, developed at Indiana<br>
University, is a hospital-based medical information system with decision support<br>
capabilities like preventive care reminders and advice regarding cost- effectiveness<br>
details during physician order entry.</div><br>
    <div>As early as 1974, RMRS began to deliver paper generated automatic reminders to the<br>
physicians the night before a patient’s visit. This intelligent system reviewed the<br>
patient’s medical record against the set of pre-defined protocols to generate reminders<br>
about the patient’s condition and to suggest corrective actions. In 1984, this report-<br>based decision support system was programmed into an interactive Gopher-based<br>
system to break the long list of reminders into logical groups, allowing physicians to step<br>
through the reminders during the physician order entry process. The success of RMRS<br>
system was due to the fact that the decision support functions were integrated with the<br>
hospital information system. The availability of required data and the knowledge base<br>
makes this a powerful system. The decision support capabilities made available to the<br>
decision makers at the point of care made this an effective product.</div><br>
    <div>In the past decade, RMRS went through a lot of developments and has included various<br>
decision support techniques such as pattern recognition and intelligent agents to help<br>
physicians assess the patterns of care and identify patients with particular risk factors<br>
and adverse outcomes. This system is used at more than 40 inpatient and outpatient<br>
facilities and the commercial version is marketed internationally.</div><br><br><br><br><br><br>
    
    <h3>PRODIGY</h3>
    <hr><br>
    <div>PRODIGY (PROject prescribing rationally with Decision support In General practice<br>
study) is a prescribing decision support system that offers evidence-based, cost<br>
effective general practice prescribing. The Sowerby Center of Health Informatics at<br>
Newcastle University was approached by the English National Health Service Executive<br>
during 1995 to develop a medical decision support system to guide UK general practi-<br>tioners on therapeutic actions covering prescribing. While developing PRODIGY, the<br>
research team realized the importance of integration with already existing general practice<br>
software used by the general practitioners. Hence integration with all the five major<br>
general practice software in the UK was performed to make PRODIGY a powerful medical<br>
decision support system.</div><br>
    <div>While several medical decision support systems assist in diagnosing the problem,<br>
PRODIGY starts after the diagnosis is made by providing medical advice and therapeutic<br>
recommendations (MedExpert-Prodigy, 2004). The system also stores patient informa-<br>tion leaflets containing information about the disease in simple terms. The trigger for<br>
decision support within PRODIGY is the input of diagnosis code. Once the physician<br>
enters the diagnosis code in their general practice system, it activates PRODIGY decision<br>
support to check if suitable medical recommendations are available. The decision maker<br>
at that point has the option to explore the recommendations or ignore it. When explored,<br>
the decision maker will be presented with therapy scenarios, evidence-based prescribing,<br>
and availability of patient information leaflets along with justification and references for<br>
the recommendations. PRODIGY medical decision support system has been successfully<br>
implemented nation wide at all general practitioners in the UK.</div><br>
    <h3>CADIAG – II (Computer Assisted DIAGnosis)</h3>
    <hr><br>
    <div>CADIAG – II is a hospital-based medical decision support system developed by the<br>
Department of Medical Computer Sciences at University of Vienna. CADIAG decision<br>
support system has been integrated with the medical information system of the Vienna<br>
General Hospital.</div><br>
    <div>CADIAG decision support system focuses on the colon diseases, rheumatic diseases,<br>
gall bladder, pancreatic diseases, and bile duct diseases (MedExpert-Cadiag, 2004). This<br>
medical decision support system provides online consultation support for the physician<br>
to assist in diagnosis of the diseases given the signs, symptoms, etiology, and laboratory<br>
results. This system contains a very strong knowledge database in the specialty areas<br>
of colon diseases and rheumatic diseases.</div><br>
    <h3>NeoGanesh</h3>
    <hr><br>
    <div>NeoGanesh is a widely cited knowledge-based decision support system that is used<br>
primarily to manage the mechanical ventilation in Intensive Care Units. This decision</div><br><br><br>
    <div>support system is one of the very few automated and controlled system with very limited<br>
human intervention. This real time medical decision support system checks for the real<br>
time data and controls the mechanical assistance provided to the patients suffering from<br>
lung diseases in a pressure supported ventilation mode (Dojat, Pachet, Guessoum,<br>
Touchard, Harf, & Brochard, 1997). The other interesting feature of the system is to<br>
develop a therapeutic strategy to respond to the patients and evaluate the capacity to<br>
breathe. This system is used at Henri Mondor Hospital in France. This system is being<br>
planned to be released for commercial purpose as well.</div><br><br>
    <center><h1>Medical Decision Support<br>
Knowledge Sharing</h1></center>
    <hr>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <hr><br>
    <div>The field of medicine has been a pioneer in the introduction of decision support systems.<br>
One of the first expert systems to be developed was in the field of medicine. The<br>
complexity of decision making in the field of medicine and the challenge of keeping up<br>
to date with the new findings and research has been a key motivator for the usage of<br>
medical decision support systems. As discussed in the previous sections, numerous<br>
medical decision support systems exist in the market. The knowledge for most of these<br>
medical decision support systems are acquired from the clinical practice guidelines<br>
issued by various government and medical associations. Clinical practice guidelines are<br>
the rule-based knowledge that guides the decision makers in a medical setting. These<br>
guidelines have been developed over the years to reduce the variations among medical<br>
practices with a common goal to provide cost effective and high quality healthcare<br>
services (Field & Lohr, 1992).</div><br>
    <div>Healthcare organizations historically have focused more on the development of the<br>
clinical practice guidelines compared to the implementation of the guidelines (Grimshaw<br>
& Russell, 1993). Past research studies have proved that the computerized medical<br>
decision support systems when integrated with the clinical workflow can improve the<br>
practitioners’ compliance with clinical practice guidelines and outcomes (Johnsons,<br>
Langton, Haynes & Mathieu, 1994). Thus, it was clear that the medical decision support<br>
systems are best vehicles to promote compliance. The availability of several decision<br>
support systems and the use of common knowledge and rules triggered the need for a<br>
common method of sharing the knowledge. This technique can save the cost of<br>
developing the same medical practice guidelines for multiple decision support systems.</div>
    <div>While it is common among organizations to share the data and information between<br>
computer systems, sharing the knowledge was a challenge. While knowledge sharing<br>
could be considered as losing competitive advantage, the healthcare industry was one<br>
of the few industries where several guidelines are common as they are generally<br>
developed by government agencies or medical associations. The medical arena rose to<br>
the occasion and various associations were involved in development of a standard way</div><br><br><br>
    <div>of sharing the medical knowledge and clinical practice guidelines among systems. In the<br>
following sections, the various prominent clinical practice guideline models and knowl-<br>edge sharing standards are discussed.</div><br>
    <h3>ARDEN Syntax</h3>
    <hr><br>
    <div>ARDEN Syntax is an ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) and ANSI<br>
(American National Standard Code for Information Interchange) standard a hybrid<br>
knowledge representation format that was created with the main aim to address the ability<br>
to share, reuse, and understand the medical knowledge base. It is first introduced in 1989<br>
at the Columbia University’s Arden homestead conference. The initial idea for the<br>
conference was to create a knowledge representation format that can facilitate the<br>
definition of knowledge bases and thus could result in an effective implementation of new<br>
knowledge consistently (Hripcsak, Pryor & Wigertz, 1995). The development of knowl-<br>edge bases is the biggest challenge faced by the ever changing medical field and<br>
introducing a knowledge representation format was thought to be of significant help to<br>
allow various institutions to share their knowledge among medical decision support<br>
systems.</div><br>
    <div>The ARDEN syntax was largely derived from the logical modules used by the HELP and<br>
RMRS medical decision support systems. The concept of the ARDEN syntax is to<br>
develop rule-based modular logical rules called medical logical modules (MLM). The<br>
medical decision support system that is based on Arden Syntax polls for the occurring<br>
events and executes the MLM’s out of its knowledge base that has defined the occurring<br>
event as the triggering condition</div><br>
    <div>In ARDEN syntax, the MLM’s are composed of slots that are grouped into three<br>
categories called maintenance, library, and knowledge. Each category has a set of<br>
predefined slots. The slots are broadly classified as textual slots, textual list slots, coded<br>
slots, and structured slots. The maintenance category contains the slots that specify<br>
general information about the MLM like title, mlmname, arden syntax version, mlm<br>
version, institution, author, specialist, date, and validation. The library category con-<br>tains slots about the knowledge base maintenance that is related to the module’s<br>
knowledge. This category contains the relevant literature, explanation, and links that<br>
were used in defining the MLM. The library category slots are purpose, explanation,<br>
keywords, citations and links. The knowledge category contains the slots that specify<br>
the real knowledge of the MLM. The knowledge category dictates the triggering event<br>
of the MLM and the logic of the MLM. The knowledge category slots are type, data,<br>
priority, evoke, logic, action, and urgency.</div><br><br>

     <em>Example</em>
    <hr></div><br>
    <div>Let us look at a simple anemia management protocol for a renal patient as an example. On<br>
receipt of new hemoglobin laboratory result, if the value is greater than 13.3, and if the<br>
patient is on Erythropoietin dose, then recommend discontinuation of the dosage. The<br>
MLM for this simple rule is given below.</div><br>
